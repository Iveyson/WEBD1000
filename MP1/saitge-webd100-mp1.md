## **3. Assignment Description / Use Case**

### **The Corah Case Study**

The **Corah Community Organization** supports **senior citizens (60+)** in rural Nova Scotia by connecting them to **local events, resources, and volunteer opportunities**.
The organization’s existing website is outdated, cluttered, and not fully accessible.
Your task is to design a plan for a modern, accessible version of the site.

**Key Goals for the Corah Website**

1. **Accessibility:** The site must be easily usable by seniors with varying digital skills and assistive technologies.
2. **Clarity:** Information should be organized so visitors can find upcoming events, news, and contact information quickly.
3. **Community Engagement:** Highlight events, volunteers, and partnerships through images and short stories.
4. **Ease of Navigation:** Use a clear header, hero section, and footer to create a consistent experience across pages.
5. **Trust & Professionalism:** Use semantic structure and well-organized content to convey credibility and care.

## **4. Tasks / Instructions**

### **Step 1 – Select a Reference Website**

Choose an existing community or event-based website similar to Corah (e.g., a non-profit or senior center site).
Record the URL and briefly describe:

* Target audience and purpose.
* What works well (visually and structurally).
* What needs improvement from a usability or accessibility perspective.

---

### **Step 2 – Evaluate Usability & Accessibility**

Use the heuristics and WCAG 2.1 principles discussed in Weeks 1–2 to evaluate the site.

| Criteria                               | Findings / Examples | Recommendations |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- |
| Navigation & Menu Structure            |                     |                 |
| Text Readability (contrast, font size) |                     |                 |
| Alt Text & Images                      |                     |                 |
| Forms & Interactive Elements           |                     |                 |
| Mobile Responsiveness                  |                     |                 |

Summarize what the reference site does well and how you can apply those lessons to Corah.

---

### **Step 3 – Identify Corah’s Key Goals and User Needs**

Before you build your content plan, confirm that your design serves Corah’s users.
Reflect on:

* How will seniors navigate the site easily?
* What information do they need most (Events, Contact, About, Volunteer)?
* What is the most important message on the homepage (hero section)?

Write 2–3 sentences summarizing how you will meet these goals in your design.

---

### **Step 4 – Create a Content Inventory**

List all the content your redesigned Corah site will contain.

| Page / Section | Content Item         | Type (Text, Image, Form, Video) | Source (Existing / New) | Priority (High / Med / Low) | Notes                             |
| :------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Homepage       | Welcome message      | Text                            | New                     | High                        | Clear, friendly intro for seniors |
| Homepage       | Hero image           | Image                           | New                     | High                        | Local community photo             |
| Events         | Upcoming events list | Text                            | Existing                | High                        | Include dates + descriptions      |
| About          | Mission statement    | Text                            | New                     | Medium                      | Short, plain language             |
| Contact        | Contact form         | Form                            | New                     | High                        | Accessible labels and ARIA roles  |

### **Step 5 – Design Your Sitemap**

Create a visual diagram showing the structure and navigation of your Corah website.
You may draw it by hand and scan/photograph it or use a digital tool such as Figma FigJam, Lucidchart, Miro, or Draw.io.

**Example Structure**

```
Home
├── Hero Section
├── Featured Events
│   ├── Event 1
│   ├── Event 2
├── About Corah
│   ├── Mission
│   ├── Our Team
└── Contact
    ├── Contact Form
    └── Newsletter Signup
```

Your sitemap should:

* Show clear navigation paths for primary and secondary users.
* Include header and footer links for usability and accessibility.

---

### **Step 6 – Reflect on Your Design Choices**

Write a short reflection (150 – 200 words):

1. What did you learn from evaluating the reference website?
2. How does your content inventory and sitemap support Corah’s key goals and audience?
3. What accessibility and usability decisions did you prioritize in your plan?

---

## **5. Deliverables**

1. Evaluation Report (1 page) – reference site URL + usability/accessibility findings.
2. Content Inventory Table (1 page or spreadsheet).
3. Sitemap Diagram (1 page or screenshot).
4. Reflection (150–200 words).
